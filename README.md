# Defect Detection
Description :This project aims to develop a machine learning model and deep learning for detecting and classifying defects in images, such as crack defects, paneling defect in bottles, and fabric holes, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).The model classifies images into defect categories or "no defect," providing a confidence score for each prediction.The model can be applied in industries like manufacturing and textiles for automated quality control

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of images categorized into four classes: crack defects, bottle defects, holes defects, and non-defects. It is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. The images are resized to 150x150 pixels and normalized for better performance. This dataset is designed to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate defect detection and classification
